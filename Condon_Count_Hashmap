# Write a program to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA based on reading frames. 
# A strand of DNA is made up of the symbols C, G, T, and A. A codon is three consecutive symbols in a strand of DNA such as ATT or TCC. 
# A reading frame is a way of dividing a strand of DNA into consecutive codons. Consider the following strand of DNA = “CGTTCAAGTTCAA”.

# There are three reading frames.

# The first reading frame starts at position 0 and has the codons: “CGT”, “TCA”, “AGT” and “TCA”. 
# Here TCA occurs twice and the others each occur once.
# The second reading frame starts at position 1 (ignoring the first C character) and has the codons: “GTT”, “CAA”, “GTT”, “CAA”. 
# Here both GTT and CAA occur twice.
# The third reading frame starts at position 2 (ignoring the first two characters CG) and has the codons: “TTC”, “AAG”, “TTC”. 
# Here TTC occurs twice and AAG occurs once.
